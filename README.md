# TL;DR
From the terminal or command line or whatever
```
git clone https://github.com/ylixir/diceware.git
cd diceware
./phrase.lua
```
# Goals
This software is meant to do two things.

1. Generate passphrases a la
[The Diceware Passphrase Home Page](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)
2. Allow anyone to easily read the source and gain trust for the software

# See also
* I found a blog post with a perl script that does the same thing as this
at [nullprogram.com](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2009/02/07/)

# TODO
* Add an option to specify the random device
* Add command line options
* Add a progress indicator (/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail)
* Add [dialware list](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2009/02/07/)

# Files
I have broken the project into many small files.
This makes each component easier to digest, but it's a lot of files.
The following is a rundown of each file.

**tl;dr** Start by looking at `phrase.lua`
  
## Word lists
These files are used for generating the passphrases and are created by `update.lua`.

The first set are the raw files as downloaded from the [diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) site.
The second set have been formatted to contain one word per line and contain nothing but the words.
  
### Downloaded lists
* `diceware.wordlist.asc`

  This file is the standard diceware wordlist. 6^5=7776 words.

* `beale.wordlist.asc`

  This file is a less 'murica centric list. Same size as the diceware list.
  
* `diceware8k.txt`

  This list sized to land evenly on bit boundaries. It is 2^13=8192 words.
  Thus it is more suitable for random numbers generated by a computer (or coin flips).
  It is less suitable for random numbers generated by physical dice.
  
### Formatted lists
* `diceware.list`
* `beal.list`
* `diceware8k.list`

## Informational files
* `COPYING`

  The license for this software. I am using the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net)
  
* `README.md`

  This is what you are reading

## Source code
* `phrase.lua`

  The main program. This is what you want to run to make everything work.
  
* `update.lua`

  This downloads and formats the word lists.
  They are already included. You probably don't need to ever use this.
  You can invoke this from the phrase.lua menu, or on it's own from the command line
  
* `object.lua`

  This provides a base object to allow us to have dice and list objects
  
* `dice.lua`
  
  This contains all the code for generating our random numbers
  
* `list.lua`
  
  This is just an object to make handling the word lists a little easier
