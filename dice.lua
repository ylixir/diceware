  Mapping from [1,2^bits] to [1,max_roll] with multiplication could cause
  certain integers to be more likely. All numbers have equal probability, so
  tossing bad numbers should not affect the quality of our randomness. Instead
  of complicating the logic of the function, we will just recurse if we fail to
  get a number in range.
